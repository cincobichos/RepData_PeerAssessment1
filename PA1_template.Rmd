###1. Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, ECHO = TRUE}
unzip ("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
library (dplyr)
meansteps<- group_by (activity, date)
```

###2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r hist meantotalsteps}
totalstepsday <- summarize (meansteps, tsd = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
hist (totalstepsday$tsd, xlab= "Steps", ylab = "Number of days", main = "Number of steps/day")
meants <- filter (totalstepsday, tsd !=0) # removing days with no measures of step numbers
mnstp <- mean (meants$tsd)
mdstp <- median(meants$tsd)
```

Mean total steps taken per day = `r mnstp`

Median total steps taken per day = `r mdstp`

###3. What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r ts average steps}
act2 <- activity [!is.na (activity$steps), ]
act3 <- group_by(act2, interval)
act4<- summarize(act3, mean (steps)) 
plot (act4, type="l", ylab= "Average number of steps", xlab= "5-min interval")
names (act4) <- (c("Int", "meansteps"))
x<- which.max(act4$meansteps)
y<- act4$Int [x] 
```

The 5-minutes interval with maximum average number of steps is `r y`, which corresponds to 8:35 AM. 

###4. Inputing missing values

```{r}
missing <- sum (is.na (activity$steps))
```

There are `r missing` rows of missing values.

The code below creates a new "act2" object in which all the missing values are replaced by the mean number of steps.

```{r}
activity2 <- activity
msteps <- mean (activity2$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
msteps
idx <- which(is.na (activity2$steps))
activity2$steps[idx] <- msteps
```

```{r meantotalsteps completed}
meansteps2<- group_by (activity2, date)
totalstepsday2 <- summarize (meansteps2, tsd= sum(steps))
hist (totalstepsday2$tsd, xlab= "Steps", ylab = "Number of days", main = "Number of steps/day")

mnst2<- mean (totalstepsday2$tsd)
mdst2 <- median(totalstepsday2$tsd)
```

Mean total steps taken per day = `r mnst2`

Median total steps taken per day = `r mdst2`

These values are very similar to the estimates from the first part of the assignment. Thus, it may be concluded that the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps is negligible.


###5. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r dif weekend weekday}
dias<- strptime (activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
semanas <- weekdays (dias)
weekend <- which (semanas == "sábado" | semanas == "domingo" ) 
weekday <- which (semanas == "segunda-feira" | semanas == "terça-feira" | semanas == "quarta-feira" | semanas == "quinta-feira" | semanas == "sexta-feira")
semanas [weekend] <- "weekend"
semanas [weekday] <- "weekday"
workday <- as.factor(semanas)
activity3 <- cbind (activity2, workday)
wd <- filter (activity3, workday == "weekday")
we <- filter (activity3, workday == "weekend")
wd2 <- group_by(wd, interval)
wd3<- summarize(wd2, mean (steps)) 
we2 <- group_by(we, interval)
we3<- summarize(we2, mean (steps)) 
par (mfrow = c (2,1), mar= c(4,4,1,1))
plot (wd3, type="l", ylab= "Number of steps", xlab= "Interval", main = "Weekdays", cex.main =1)
plot (we3, type="l", ylab= "Number of steps", xlab= "Interval", main = "Weekends", cex.main = 1)

```
